The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if you're not careful with operator precedence and unit usage. For instance, mixing percentages and pixels directly within `calc()` can cause layout inconsistencies across different browsers or screen sizes.  Another issue arises when dealing with negative values; unexpected behavior may occur if you don't use parentheses correctly to group operations involving negative numbers.
