To avoid these problems, always explicitly define units for all values within the `calc()` function. Ensure that you use parentheses `()` to control the order of operations, especially when dealing with addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  For example, instead of `width: calc(100% - 20px);`, which might lead to variations, use `width: calc(100% - 20px);` to ensure consistent behavior. When working with negative values, use parentheses to avoid ambiguity.  For instance, `margin: calc(50% - 100px);` is safer than `margin: calc(50% - 100px);`.
